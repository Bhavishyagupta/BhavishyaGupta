## Hi, I’m Bhavishya Gupta 👋

I am a **Design Verification Engineer** with strong experience in **SystemVerilog/UVM–based verification**,  
**assertion-based verification**, and **coverage-driven closure** for complex digital systems.  
I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University** (May 2026),  
with a strong focus on **computer architecture, ASIC verification, and micro-architecture validation**.

---

### 🧠 Technical Focus
- Design Verification using **SystemVerilog, UVM, UVMF**
- **Assertion-Based Verification (SVA)**, failure triage, and root-cause analysis
- **Functional, cross, and code coverage** planning and closure
- Debugging **RTL and netlist** regressions
- Verification of **micro-architecture blocks, controllers, and memory subsystems**

---

### 🏗️ Computer Architecture Background
- CPU pipeline verification (Fetch / Decode / Execute / Mem / Writeback)
- Instruction-level behavior, control flow, and branch handling
- Cache and memory hierarchy concepts
- Out-of-order execution concepts (ROB, RMT, Issue Queue, IPC analysis)
- Coursework in **Microprocessor Architecture**, **Architecture of Parallel Computers**, and **FPGA & ASIC Design**

---

### 💼 Professional Experience
**Design Verification Intern — Micron Technology (San Jose, CA)**  
- Developed verification infrastructure including assertions, debug utilities, and coverage analysis  
- Built an automated **assertion triaging framework** to reduce regression debug noise  
- Contributed to feature verification and regression bring-up through cross-functional collaboration  

**Design Verification Engineer II — Micron Technology, India**  
- Verified multiple generations of **3D NAND flash** across TLC/QLC technologies  
- Owned features end-to-end: test planning, UVM sequence development, assertion strategy, regression, and debug  
- Designed, reviewed, and maintained **2,000+ SystemVerilog assertions** across datapath, timing, and control logic  
- Drove **coverage closure** by identifying hard-to-hit corner cases and creating targeted test scenarios  

---

### 🧪 Projects
- **LC-3 Microcontroller Verification (UVMF)**  
  Stage-level UVCs for a 5-stage pipeline with predictor/scoreboard-based end-to-end checking and functional coverage  

- **I²C Multi-Bus Controller Verification**  
  UVM-based verification of Wishbone-to-I²C controller using assertions, constrained-random stimulus, and ~99.5% coverage  

- **YAPP Packet Router Verification**  
  Multi-UVC UVM environment with RAL, constrained-random packet generation, and TLM scoreboard  

- **Out-of-Order Superscalar Processor Simulator (C++)**  
  Cycle-accurate simulator with ROB, RMT, IQ, and IPC analysis across benchmarks  

---

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: SystemVerilog, SVA, UVM/UVMF, Python, C/C++  
- **Simulators/Tools**: Questa, Xcelium, VCS, JasperGold, Git, Make  
- **Domains**: Design Verification, Computer Architecture, Memory Systems, Low-Power Verification
